Functional programming aims for simplicity and avoids side effects by favoring immutable data structures.\"\"\",\n",
    "        'answer3': \"\"\"Functional programming focuses on immutability, pure functions, and higher-order functions, avoiding mutable data. It uses function compositions for computation. On the other hand, object-oriented programming (OOP) centers around objects that encapsulate data and behavior, employing classes, inheritance, and polymorphism to model real-world entities. Functional programming treats functions as first-class citizens, while OOP emphasizes encapsulation and modularity.\"\"\"\n",

    "        'answer1': \"\"\"The primary purpose of unit testing is to validate individual units or components of code to ensure they function as intended. It helps identify and fix bugs early in the development process, ensuring that each part of the code works correctly in isolation. Implementing unit tests involves writing test cases for each function or method to verify its behavior against expected outcomes. I would use testing frameworks like JUnit, pytest, or Mocha, depending on the programming language, to create test cases that cover different scenarios and edge cases. These tests are executed regularly, ideally in an automated manner, to guarantee ongoing code integrity.\"\"\",\n",

    "        'answer1': \"\"\"Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. They offer proven templates for solving issues in a specific context, aiding in the creation of flexible and maintainable software. Commonly used design patterns include the Singleton, which ensures a class has only one instance; the Factory Method, allowing the creation of objects without specifying their exact class; the Observer, establishing a one-to-many dependency between objects, enabling automatic state change notification; and the Strategy, enabling interchangeable algorithms within a family of classes. These design patterns address various scenarios and contribute to better software architecture.\"\"\",\n",
